# population_genetics_symulator
 This programe symulate the growth of a population and the way proportions of genetic traits evolve along time.
 The assumptions made are the following:
 
 the universe (developemnt space of turtles) is confined.
 the turtles movement follow two rules, depending on the reproduction state (fertile or infertile); if fertile, the turtle is going to move looking for a partner for mating, otherwise the turtle's movement is going to be random in all directions.
 genotype of the offpring of two parents follows mendelian inheritance laws.
 there is not environment variance effect, neither genetics + environment effects considerations, only genetics effects. 
 the first generation is of 'purebred line', that means, the starting population is homozigous.
