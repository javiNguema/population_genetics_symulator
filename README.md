# population_genetics_symulator
This program simulates the growth of a population and tracks the evolution of genetic traits over time. The assumptions guiding this simulation are as follows:

1. The universe (development space of turtles) is confined.
2. The movement of turtles follows two rules based on their reproductive state: if fertile, the turtle seeks a mate for mating, otherwise, the turtle's movement is random in all directions.
3. The genotype of offspring from two parents follows Mendelian inheritance laws.
4. There is no environmental variance effect, nor considerations for genetic-environmental effects; only genetic effects are considered.
5. The initial generation consists of a 'purebred line', signifying that the starting population is homozygous.
